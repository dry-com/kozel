- Choose the wallet where you want to receive the withdrawn tokens. You can search by address or select from your saved wallets.

### 2. Choose Network

### 3. Configure Withdrawal
- In the **Withdraw Token from Exchange** block, configure the withdrawal details:
  - **Token Address**: Input the address of the token you want to withdraw from the exchange.
  - **Amount**: Enter the amount of tokens to withdraw. You can also choose `"MAX"` to withdraw all available tokens.
  - **Exchange Address**: Enter the centralized exchange's address where the tokens are currently stored.
