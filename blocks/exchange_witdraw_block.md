# Exchange Withdraw Block

This document describes the **Exchange Withdraw Block** UI component, which provides an interface for performing token withdrawals from an exchange. Users can withdraw any token on any available network from any connected exchange using this block. It can be used multiple times and anywhere in your task, but it must appear after the **Start** and **Wallet** blocks.
