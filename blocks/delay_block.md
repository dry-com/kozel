# Delay Block

This document describes the **Delay Block** user interface component, which allows users to insert a custom wait/delay step into their workflow in three ways: statically, randomly, and progressively. You can insert this block anywhere and use it multiple times, but it **MUST** follow the Start and Wallet blocks.

## üìã Overview

The block has three types:

- **Static Delay**: This block type uses a static delay in seconds. 
- **Progress Delay**: This block type uses a progressive delay in seconds, which consists of a minimum delay, a maximum delay, and a delay between each wallet in seconds.  
- **Random Delay**: This block type uses a random delay in seconds, which consists of a minimum, maximum delay in seconds.

| **Static Delay Input**       | When `Static` is selected: a text field labeled ‚ÄúDelay‚Äù (seconds).                                    |
| **Min Delay Input**          | When `Progress` or `Random` is selected: a field labeled ‚ÄúMin delay‚Äù (seconds).                      |
| **Max Delay Input**          | When `Progress` or `Random` is selected: a field labeled ‚ÄúMax delay‚Äù (seconds).                      |
| **Delay Between Input**      | When selecting `Progress`: the field labeled "Delay between" (seconds) is the increment of the step between wallets.         |
| **Clear Button**             | Resets type selection and all delay inputs to their defaults.                                         |
| **Save Button**              | Saves the current delay configuration and applies it to the workflow.                                 |
