# Bridge Block

This document describes the **Bridge Block** user interface component that allows users to switch tokens to another network. The switch is made from the network selected in the **Switch Network Block** and goes to the network selected by the user. After entering the tokens (from and to) and the amount, the user must click the `Check bridge` button to get the available dApps to perform the token switch. The user must then select one of the available dApps and save the block.
