# Exchange Deposit Block

This document describes the **Exchange Deposit Block** UI component, which provides an interface for depositing tokens to exchanges. Users can send any tokens supported by the exchange to any supported network using this block. However, before doing so, they must first link the deposit address to a wallet on the corresponding network. This is done by uploading the addresses to the connected exchange in the settings. This block can be used multiple times and anywhere in your task, but it must be placed after the **Start** and **Wallet** blocks.
