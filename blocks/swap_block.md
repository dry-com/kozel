# Swap Block

This document describes the **Swap Block** UI component, which provides an interface for performing a swap. With this block, users can perform swaps on the available DEXs based on their selected network in the **Switch Network Block**. Additionally, there is an option for a custom swap, where users need to input the router contract and/or the factory contract, depending on the pool version.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

The block has two types:

- **Default swap**: This is a normal swap that will be done on one of your chosen Dex (if there are Dexs on the network you chose).
- **Custom swap**: This is a custom swap where you need to input the router contract and/or the factory contract, depending on the pool version. It is usually used if your chosen network does not have a supported Dex, or if you want to use a custom swap yourself.
